                    <h3>Data Structures</h3>
                    <p>In this course, I built upon my foundational programming skills by focusing on program design,
                        analysis, and verification, alongside an introduction to essential data structures. Data
                        structures are critical for efficiently storing and manipulating data in complex computer
                        programs, ensuring optimal memory usage and runtime while maintaining scalability for large
                        datasets.</p>
                    <p>I gained hands-on experience with some of the most important data structures, including lists,
                        stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables. I also developed the ability to analyze their efficiency
                        using a mathematical approach. The course emphasized writing clear, modular code that is easy to
                        read, debug, and modify. I've had the chance to work as a Learning asisstant my Sophomore year
                        and am glad to return for my senior year!</p>
                    <p><strong>Key outcomes from this course include:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understanding the design, implementation, and trade-offs of fundamental data structures.
                        </li>
                        <li>Developing the ability to reason about program efficiency within a consistent, mathematical
                            framework.</li>
                        <li>Gaining practical experience in designing and implementing complex, modular programs.</li>

                    <h3>IBM Data Analyst</h3>
                    <p>I earned the IBM Professional Certificate in Data Analytics by completing an intensive 9-course
                        program focused on core data analysis principles and practical applications. Throughout the
                        program, I gained hands-on experience with diverse data sources and real-world project
                        scenarios, working extensively with tools such as Excel, SQL, Relational Databases, Python,
                        Jupyter Notebooks, and Cognos Analytics.</p>
                    <p>I developed strong skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, enabling me to
                        create visualizations, interactive dashboards, and comprehensive reports. This certification has
                        equipped me with the analytical techniques and practical experience necessary for an entry-level
                        role in data analytics.

                    <h3>App Development</h3>
                    <p>In this class, I learned how to build cross-platform mobile applications for both Android and
                        iOS. The course focused heavily on front-end development and creating intuitive, user-friendly
                        interfaces.</p>

                    <h4>Key Learnings:</h4>

                    <h4>Cross-Platform Mobile Development</h4>
                    <p>I learned the entire process of developing mobile apps, from initial idea to final publication.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Human-Centered Design</h4>
                    <p>This approach emphasized involving users from the start of the design process and keeping their
                        needs central throughout development. It was about creating not just functional apps but ones
                        that truly understood and met user expectations.</p>

                    <h4>Development Tools</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript on Node.js:</strong> I explored how Node.js extends JavaScript’s
                            capabilities beyond browser scripting, making it a versatile language for various
                            applications.</li>
                        <li><strong>React & React Native:</strong> I used React to build user interfaces and React
                            Native to develop cross-platform apps. React’s component-based architecture helped manage
                            state and render UIs effectively, while React Native allowed me to translate JavaScript into
                            native commands on mobile devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Expo:</strong> This tool made development smoother by providing pre-configured
                            templates and a library of ready-to-use components. It also simplified testing and
                            deployment with its development server and Expo Go app.</li>
                        <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> I used Firebase to handle backend configuration and content
                            management. It was great for quickly building MVPs and keeping costs low during the
                            prototyping phase.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Overall, the course provided a solid foundation in mobile app development and introduced me to
                        essential tools and practices in the field.</p>
