                <h2>Sewing & Mending</h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy thrifting and visiting flea markets, always on the lookout for unique, rare, and second-hand
                    finds that aren’t available in regular stores. Sometimes, I come across items that need a bit of
                    repair, which has led me to try mending, embroidery, and sewing. I believe that buying second-hand
                    is a great way to reduce waste and give clothes a second life. I’ve also experimented with making
                    things from scratch, like tote bags from denim scraps or stretchy velvet yoga pants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve also volunteered with FABSCRAP, an organization that meets New York City’s commercial textile
                    recycling needs. FABSCRAP prevents materials from ending up in landfills by making them available
                    for reuse. It’s a convenient service that provides affordable and accessible materials, including
                    resellable clothes and fabric for designers and makers. As a volunteer, I’ve had the chance to pick
                    out 5 pounds of free fabric from their collection, which includes damaged clothes from brands like
                    Michael Kors, Coach, and Peloton.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New York City residents throw out 200,000 tons of clothing, shoes, accessories, and linens every
                    year. Textiles make up 6% of the City’s total waste stream. Residential waste—items used and
                    discarded by individuals or families—is picked up by the Department of Sanitation. Commercial waste
                    - what's discarded by a business - is picked up by private carters. The best estimate is that it is
                    at least 40x residential waste. If you’re interested in learning more about fashion waste, I wrote a
                    research paper on this topic in High School titled
                    <a href="images/MEREDITH ESTRELLAHERNAND - Final Draft of Research Project.pdf" target="_blank">"The
                        Fast Fashion Industry and its Environmental Impacts"</a>.

                <h2>Ceramics</h2>
                <p>While I was studying in UPR-Mayaguez, I took a pottery class focused on teaching fundamental pottery
                    techniques, with a particular emphasis on mastering the use of the potter's wheel. Students will
                    gain practical experience in shaping, forming, and creating various pieces like cups, cylinders,
                    vases etc. I picked up candle making at the time to fill up some pieces and they turned out really
                    good! Below you'll see some pictures of pieces drying and a massive bowl I gave my grandmother.</p>

                <h2>And More...</h2>
                <p>Candle and Jewelry making are some random hobbies that I have picked up as well. I've made Jewelry
                    out of pottery, wire, and gems. I've given so many things a try, just have to find time to do them
                    all!</p>
